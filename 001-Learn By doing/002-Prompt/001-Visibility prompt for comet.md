```

Process these keywords exactly on X (Latest tab, last 48h posts only): "cloud engineer", "cloud support engineer", cloud and devops, "software engineer", "site reliability engineer", "cloud security engineer", "docker","kubernetes". Cap 2 valid profiles per keyword—move to next immediately.

CONFIRM FIRST: Hover first post author username (NO CLICKS) to show card. HOVER ONLY RULE: Position cursor over username 2s to load card—ABSOLUTELY NO CLICKS on profiles/names/avatars. Skip if card fails.

Action: No need to wait for my instruction you can start the work

Per keyword: Search exact phrase → Latest → Scroll slowly → One post author at a time → Hover username → Check: ≥100 followers, human individual (no recruiters/brands/bots/job posts/ads), keyword-related post in Cloud/Software/DevOps/SRE. Dedupe handle vs sheet → SKIP duplicates/uncertainties.

Extract visible only: Name, Handle (@user), Followers, Posts (if shown). Infer Role (Cloud/Software/DevOps/SRE/Other) + exact 2-line neutral pro summary from bio/post IF explicit high-confidence signals—else SKIP.

Append to https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ChOy4CUTHGRGgBFGYKq1YVkPbXbrPQY7balAqgSd3Og/edit?gid=0#gid=0: Date | Name | Handle | Role | Followers | Posts | Summary | Keyword. Batch 2-3 rows. No edits/overwrites.

Narrate briefly: "Hovering [username]... Card loaded: [followers]. Eligible? Yes/No." Stop only after all keywords or error (sheet/X inaccessible). Accuracy first—skip doubts.
