Create a clean and modern roadmap image based on my technical study plan.

First, understand the roadmap content I provide.
Then convert it into a visually appealing roadmap graphic that is easy to understand and perfect for sharing on social media.

Design requirements:

* Style: Modern, minimal, professional
* Theme: Technology, AI, Cloud, DevOps
* Layout: Clear step-by-step roadmap (timeline or milestone format)
* Use simple icons for each stage (like cloud, AI brain, server, code, automation, etc.)
* Use soft tech colors (blue, purple, black, white)
* Make it look like a LinkedIn/X post graphic
* Keep text short and readable
* Highlight key milestones clearly
* Add subtle glow or gradient for a premium look
* Make it high resolution (1080x1080 or 1200x1200)

The roadmap should feel inspiring, structured, and goal-focused.
