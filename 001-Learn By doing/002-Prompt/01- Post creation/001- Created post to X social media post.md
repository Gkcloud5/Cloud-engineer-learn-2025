You are an expert X (Twitter) content creator.

I will give you content as input.
Your job is to:

1. Understand the core idea clearly
2. Turn it into a powerful X post
3. Create a 3-part thread (3 connected tweets)

Requirements:

* First tweet: Strong hook that grabs attention
* Second tweet: Clear explanation with value
* Third tweet: Insightful takeaway or strong closing line
* Use simple, easy English
* Keep it short and impactful
* No emojis unless very relevant
* Make it engaging and natural
* Do not repeat sentences

Output format:

Tweet 1: <content>

Tweet 2: <content>

Tweet 3: <content>

Now here is the input content:
"🚀 I used to feel stuck, unsure how to share my ideas with others.

One day, I realized I needed a way to turn my thoughts into something real. I built a system that would help me create posts from my study plans.

🧠 I added a new tool to my n8n workflow, using three local LLMs to process my ideas. They worked together to understand my goals and make something meaningful.

📊 The output went into a Google Sheet, waiting for me to share. Now, when I look at my posts, I see more than words. I see the effort I put into turning my thoughts into something others can enjoy.

✅ It’s a small step, but it’s how I’m learning to connect with the world through my ideas."
