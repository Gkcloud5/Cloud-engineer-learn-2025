# 🧠 Operating System — 10-Day Learning Plan (80/20 Focus)

> 🎯 **Goal:** Master the 20% of OS concepts that give 80% of understanding.
> 📅 **Duration:** 10 Days
> 💪 **Focus:** Concept clarity → Visualization → Application

---

## ⚙️ Core Learning Principle (80/20)
Spend your effort on the most impactful topics:
- Understanding how OS manages CPU, memory, and processes
- Grasping how it connects hardware ↔ software
- Applying concepts to real-world systems like Linux, Docker, and virtualization

## 🗓️ 10-Day Plan

### ✅ Day 1 — OS Overview
- [ ] What is an Operating System?
- [ ] Functions of OS
- [ ] Types of OS (Batch, Time-Sharing, Real-time, etc.)
- [ ] OS architecture (User → OS → Hardware)
🧩 **Activity:** Draw OS architecture in your notes  
💭 *Reflection:* What role does the OS play between hardware and user programs?

---

### ✅ Day 2 — System Architecture
- [ ] Kernel, Shell, and System Calls
- [ ] Monolithic vs. Microkernel
- [ ] Example: Compare Linux vs Windows OS
🧩 **Activity:** Sketch kernel interactions  
💭 *Reflection:* How does a system call work when you open a file?

---

### ✅ Day 3 — Process Management (Part 1)
- [ ] What is a Process & Process Control Block (PCB)
- [ ] Process lifecycle
- [ ] Scheduler types (Long, Short, Medium)
🧩 **Activity:** Explain with example — How Chrome manages multiple tabs  
💭 *Reflection:* What happens when you open a new tab in Chrome?

---

### ✅ Day 4 — Process & Thread (Part 2)
- [ ] Threads vs Processes
- [ ] Context switching
- [ ] Interprocess Communication (IPC)
🧩 **Activity:** WhatsApp message sending/receiving analogy  
💭 *Reflection:* Why are threads faster than processes?

---

### ✅ Day 5 — CPU Scheduling
- [ ] FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, Priority Scheduling
- [ ] Turnaround and waiting time
🧩 **Activity:** Solve 2 small scheduling examples  
💭 *Reflection:* Why isn’t FCFS always efficient?

---

### ✅ Day 6 — Deadlocks
- [ ] Deadlock conditions
- [ ] Prevention, Avoidance, Detection
🧩 **Activity:** Traffic jam analogy (represent graphically)  
💭 *Reflection:* Which condition must be broken to prevent deadlocks?

---

### ✅ Day 7 — Memory Management (Part 1)
- [ ] Logical vs Physical memory
- [ ] Paging and Segmentation
🧩 **Activity:** Visualize paging with diagram  
💭 *Reflection:* Why is paging used in modern systems?

---

### ✅ Day 8 — Memory Management (Part 2)
- [ ] Virtual Memory
- [ ] Demand Paging, Page Fault, Thrashing
🧩 **Activity:** Research how Windows handles virtual memory  
💭 *Reflection:* What happens when RAM is full?

---

### ✅ Day 9 — File & I/O Management
- [ ] File system organization
- [ ] File access methods (Sequential, Direct, Indexed)
- [ ] Device drivers & I/O buffer
🧩 **Activity:** Explore your OS directory structure  
💭 *Reflection:* How does OS know which file belongs to which app?

---

### ✅ Day 10 — Real-World Mapping + Revision
- [ ] OS in Cloud, Virtualization, Containers (Docker)
- [ ] Review all notes
🧩 **Activity:** Create a mind map linking all OS concepts to real-world tools  
💭 *Reflection:* Which 3 OS concepts are used daily in cloud systems?
