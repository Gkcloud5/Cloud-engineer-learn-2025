**📚 Topics:**  
- Role of OS between user & hardware  
- Functions: process, memory, file, I/O, security  
- Types: Batch, Time-sharing, Real-time  

**💡 Real-Life Example:**  
OS is like a company manager — allocates tasks, manages workers (processes), and handles resources.

**🧠 Task:**  
- [x] Draw OS architecture (User → OS → Hardware)  
- [x] Note 5 core OS responsibilities  
- [x] Write: “Why OS is essential in computers?”

---

## 🧩 Day 2: **System Architecture & Components**

**🎯 Focus:** How OS internally communicates with hardware.  
**📚 Topics:**  
- Kernel, Shell, System calls  
- Monolithic vs Microkernel  
- User mode vs Kernel mode  

**💡 Real-Life Example:**  
Kernel = brain; Shell = face; System call = translator.

**💻 Task:**  
- [x] Run `uname -a` on Linux/macOS  
- [x] Identify kernel version  
- [x] Note difference between kernel and shell  

---

## 🧩 Day 3: **Process Management (Core of OS)**

**🎯 Focus:** How OS handles programs in execution.  
**📚 Topics:**  
- Process states: New, Ready, Running, Waiting, Terminated  
- PCB (Process Control Block)  
- Context switching  

**💡 Real-Life Example:**  
Factory analogy: workers (processes) doing assigned tasks.

**💻 Task:**  
- [x] Run `ps aux` or open Task Manager  
- [x] Observe process IDs and states  
- [x] Note 3 observations about process switching  

---

## 🧩 Day 4: **CPU Scheduling**

**🎯 Focus:** How OS decides which process gets CPU time.  
**📚 Topics:**  
- Scheduling algorithms: FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, Priority  
- Preemptive vs Non-preemptive scheduling  
- CPU utilization and turnaround time  

**💡 Real-Life Example:**  
A chef (CPU) cooking multiple orders (processes).

**🧠 Task:**  
- [x] Simulate scheduling for 3 processes (burst times: 5, 3, 8)  
- [x] Calculate waiting and turnaround times manually  
- [x] Identify which algorithm is most efficient  

---

## 🧩 Day 5: **Threads & Concurrency**

**🎯 Focus:** Parallelism in processes.  
**📚 Topics:**  
- Process vs Thread  
- Multithreading benefits  
- Context switch between threads  

**💡 Real-Life Example:**  
Multiple hands (threads) working on one task (process).

**💻 Task:**  
- [x] Write simple Python code with `threading` module  
- [x] Observe concurrent execution  
- [x] Note difference between concurrency and parallelism  

---

## 🧩 Day 6: **Interprocess Communication (IPC)**

**🎯 Focus:** How processes communicate and share data.  
**📚 Topics:**  
- Message passing, Shared memory  
- Synchronization, Pipes  
- Race conditions  

**💡 Real-Life Example:**  
Two chefs (processes) sharing one cutting board (memory).

**💻 Task:**  
- [ ] Create Python `multiprocessing` example (Queue or Pipe)  
- [ ] Send messages between two processes  
- [ ] Note how data is synchronized  

---

## 🧩 Day 7: **Memory Management**

**🎯 Focus:** How OS allocates and manages memory.  
**📚 Topics:**  
- Paging, Segmentation  
- Virtual Memory  
- Page table and swapping  

**💡 Real-Life Example:**  
Library shelf (RAM) and borrowing books (Virtual Memory).

**🧠 Task:**  
- [x] Draw memory layout: Stack, Heap, Code, Data  
- [x] Note what grows upward/downward  
- [x] Explain how paging improves performance  

---

## 🧩 Day 8: **File System Management**

**🎯 Focus:** How OS stores, organizes, and secures data.  
**📚 Topics:**  
- Directory structure  
- FAT, Inodes  
- File permissions  

**💡 Real-Life Example:**  
File cabinet with folders, labels, and locks.

**💻 Task:**  
- [ ] Run `ls -l`, `chmod`, `touch` on Linux  
- [ ] Observe file permissions and owner info  
- [x] Note how OS prevents unauthorized access  

---

## 🧩 Day 9: **I/O & Device Management**

**🎯 Focus:** How OS handles input/output devices.  
**📚 Topics:**  
- Buffering, Caching, Spooling  
- Device drivers  
- Interrupt handling  

**💡 Real-Life Example:**  
Printer queue = spooling; cache = waiting area for quick reuse.

**💻 Task:**  
- [ ] Observe printer or download queue behavior  
- [ ] Identify where buffering or caching occurs  
- [ ] Note one example of I/O bottleneck  

---

## 🧩 Day 10: **Deadlocks, Security & Final Review**

**🎯 Focus:** How OS avoids system freezes and protects resources.  
**📚 Topics:**  
- Deadlock conditions  
- Deadlock prevention and detection  
- OS security basics  

**💡 Real-Life Example:**  
Traffic jam (deadlock) — all cars waiting for each other.

**💻 Task:**  
- [ ] Simulate a deadlock in Python using two threads with locks  
- [ ] Note the 4 conditions of deadlock  
- [ ] Summarize your 10-day OS journey in your own words
