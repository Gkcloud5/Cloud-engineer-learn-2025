## Concept:
 * OS is system software that acts as a bridge between user and computer hardware
 * It manages hardware resources and allows software programs to run smoothly

----
## Major functions of OS:
1. Process Management => Runs and controls multiple programs at once
2. Memory Management => Allocates and tracks usage of RAM
3. File Management => Organizes and controls data on storage devices
4. Device manager => Handles input and output from devices like mouse, keyboard
5. Security and access control => Protects data and manages user permission

### Types of OS:
1. Batch OS --> one program at one time
2. Time-Sharing OS --> Allow many process at same time
3. Real-time OS --> Responds instantly to inputs, used where timing is critical
	1. Robotics
4. Distributed OS --> Manages multiple computers as a single system 
	1. Cloud servers
5. Mobile OS --> Designed for mobile and tablets
	1. Android
	2. IOS
