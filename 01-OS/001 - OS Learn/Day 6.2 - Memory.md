**Here we are going to see how OS use limited RAM to complete the process efficiently**

### 6.2.1 What is memory management?
* Every process in OS needs memory to run or execute program
* Memory manager decides:
	* Who gets memory and how much
	* When to swap in and out
	* How to protect one memory to another
	* How to run smoothly without crashing or overlapping

```
Memory management will do allocate, organise and optimize system memory(RAM + Virtual memory)
```

### 6.2.2 Memory layout of a process:
* Every process in memory divided into logical section
	* Stack
	* Heap
	* Data segment
	* Code segment

```
|----------------------------|  High Memory
|         Stack              |  ðŸ”» Grows Downward
|----------------------------|
|         Heap               |  ðŸ”º Grows Upward
|----------------------------|
|         Data Segment       |  (global/static variables)
|----------------------------|
|         Code Segment       |  (program instructions)
|----------------------------|  Low Memory

```

### 6.2.3 Paging:
* Paging is dividing memory small fixed boxes, equal size small boxed calls pages.
* It will avoid memory waste
* Page -- fixed size block in virtual memory
* Frame -- Physical memory blocks in RAM
* Page table --maps virtual pages --> Physical memory
* It eliminating fragmentation
	* Ensuring every small piece of RAM is used optimally

---
### 6.2.4 Segmentation:
* It divided memory based on logical section of a program
	* It will be in different size, size will be based on logical section value

|Segment|Contains|Example|
|---|---|---|
|**Code Segment**|Instructions|Your programâ€™s logic|
|**Data Segment**|Global/static data|Configuration values|
|**Stack Segment**|Local variables, function calls|Temporary values|
|**Heap Segment**|Dynamically allocated memory|Objects created at runtime|
