* In network when data come and go we need to protect so that only we will give security of our process.


### 8.1 why?
* Generally in internet lot of device trying to connect our device so we need to protect out
* We need:
	* Control --> Decide what data is allowed or not
	* Privacy --> Keep communication secure and hidden
	* Integrity --> Ensure data is not tampered 
* Firewall, VPN, encryption protocol do

### 8.2 Firewalls: (Hardware and Software)
#### 8.2.1 What is firewall?
* Firewall is security guard of network
	* Check incoming and outgoing packets and decide which packets allow or block them based on rules
	* Types:
		* Software: Runs on individual computers to protect system
		* Hardware: Physical devices btw network and internet --> router


### 8.3 Packet filtering and access control:
#### 8.3.1 Packet filtering:
* Firewall check each packets and check it's rules
	* Source IP/Destination IP address
	* Port - source/destination
	* Protocol - TCP, UDP, ICMP

#### 8.3.2 Access Control:
* Allow or deny.

### 8.4 VPN Basics:
* Virtual Private network
* It will create secure a encrypted tunnel between devices and a remote server over a network
* It hides:
	* Real IP address
	* Data content
	* Destination websites
* Tunneling, encryption and protocol

### 8.5 HTTPS, SSL, SSH, TLS:
* HTTPS --> Encrypted Communication to prevent data
* SSL/TLS --> Secure Socket layer/Transport layer
