### 1.1 What is GIT?

✔️ **Git = Time Machine + Collaboration Tool**

* It helps you:
	* Save changes (like saving versions of your project)
	* Go back to old version at anytime
	* Work safely with a team
	* Track every line changed
	* Deploy code using CI/CD pipeline

### 1.2 The 3 Places where files lives
#### 1.2.1 Working directory: 
* Where actual files on Linux

#### 1.2.2 Staging area:
* Files you are preparing to save

#### 1.2.3 Repository: local repo
* Final saved version

Working Directory → Staging → Local Repo
Local Repo → Remote Repo (GitHub)


### 1.2.3 Core commands:

* Check what changed --> `git status`
* Add file to staging --> `git add fileName`
* Add all files --> `git .`
* Save changes in local repo --> `git commit -m "Commit message"`
* Upload to github --> `git push`
