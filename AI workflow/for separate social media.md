For past few days when i post the AI genereated content in linkedIN, reddit and X i could see it's not fit on it, looks more normal post like other AI genereated. so what i am going to do is i believe each social platform has unique way of life so as per that i am planning to create a content via my workflow. 
for initial step i am going to create a seperate workflow for linkedIN alone. my goal is create post that more engageblen and target audience like the way and attracting way
This is my next plan in my workflow, let's see

Yeah, it's really hard handling creating workflow i mean system for me and doing office work and learn cloud and devops to switch the job but somehow i am enjoying it, hope eveything will be fine!..
