## Day plan to hour plan

```
Consider yourself an expert in the topic or learning plan I provide. You have completed many real-world projects in this field.

Your task is to:

1. Carefully understand my learning plan.
2. Create a **3-hour focused study plan** for one day.
3. Help me understand **basic fundamentals clearly** (I am a beginner).
4. Include **hands-on practical tasks** so I can struggle, practice, and learn deeply.
5. Structure the 3 hours clearly (example: 45 min learning + 60 min practice + 45 min mini-build + 30 min review).
6. End the session with a **small practical output or mini-project** I can complete in that session.
7. Keep everything beginner-friendly and practical.
8. Avoid unnecessary theory and keep explanations simple.

If anything in my plan is unclear, ask specific questions before creating the study plan.
