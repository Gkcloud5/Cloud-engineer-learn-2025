## The 80/20 Rule Applied to OS Learning

Hereâ€™s the **20% of OS concepts** that deliver **80% of practical knowledge and interview value**:

| Category                             | Key 20% Concepts                                                                               | Real-world Connection                              |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Process Management**            | Process lifecycle, context switching, scheduling algorithms, inter-process communication (IPC) | How multitasking works, why your system slows down |
| **2. Memory Management**             | Paging, segmentation, virtual memory, page replacement                                         | How RAM is used efficiently, why swapping happens  |
| **3. File Systems**                  | Inodes, FAT vs NTFS, journaling, file descriptors                                              | How files are stored, deleted, or corrupted        |
| **4. I/O Management**                | Buffers, device drivers, interrupts                                                            | How keyboard/mouse input is handled                |
| **5. Concurrency & Synchronization** | Mutex, semaphore, deadlock, race condition                                                     | How multiple programs share resources safely       |
| **6. OS Architecture & Kernel**      | Monolithic, microkernel, user mode vs kernel mode                                              | Why Linux is fast and secure                       |
| **7. System Calls**                  | `fork()`, `exec()`, `wait()`, `open()`, `read()`, `write()`                                    | How programs talk to the OS                        |
